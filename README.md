# User Login-SignUp
------------------
A Authenticator site made with NextJS, Typescript and some libraries. With this, you can instantiate several users (using name and password). In order not to have extra work, the node-json-db library was used, which creates a local "Database". The project was made with the purpose of learning about Typescript and NextJS (there was already previous knowledge in API). The renderings ended up being left out, as I didn't have the trouble to create a front end.
